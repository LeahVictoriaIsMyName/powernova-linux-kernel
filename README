The Problem with N x Uzi

This post isn't meant to be offensive, it is just explaining why N x Uzi shouldn't work.

First off, there's the obvious problem of Uzi and N clearly having crushes on Thad and V. This is undeniable, since N says it himself he has a crush on V, and Uzi not only acts embarrassed when Thad compliments her bandages, but also straight up calls him attractive right before the fight scene in episode one.

Exact quote: "Put that confessionally attractive male down!" - Uzi

Secondly, there's the way they act towards each other. N is clearly seeing Uzi as a friend, or at least for emotional support. It is clear N is... in the least offensive way, special, since he gets yelled at and beaten by the people he still thinks are his friends. He also has extreme loyalty to his "friends", which can often be misread as love. As for Uzi, she, to be brutally honest, also abuses N. Constantly hitting him, yelling at him, and scolding him, just like the other murder drones. Clearly, Uzi does not have love for N, which is to be expected, as he killed dozens of her friends and ancestors.

J: "N, you are worthless and terrible, (N: "thank you") and if the company allowed it, I would kill you myself".

N after flashback: "J's awesome"
