Powernova Kernel
===============

The Powernova Linux Kernel, shortened to Powernova Kernel is a kernel customized enough for speed on AMD Bulldozer derived CPUs, they include all the AMD FX and most of the AMD PRO series (That dont base off any Zen arch)
Whatever works for me, this is a very barely customized kernel that just tries to implement Linux Zen and mix them with the Arch Specific Kernel, also using fixes for the Android Common Kernel, The Generic Kernel Image and the Android Generic Kernel, basically mixing the kernels for an attempt to an "Universal kernel"
Powernova comes from the following:
Power - Power
nova - new
Powernova = New Power
Powernova Linux Kernel = New Power Linux Kernel

Thank you fry for teaching me that you can do funny shit here, ilysm
